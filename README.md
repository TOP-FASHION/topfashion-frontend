</p>

This is a demo of how to use the *Universal* family of packages:

- [react-universal-component](https://github.com/faceyspacey/react-universal-component) 
- [webpack-flush-chunks](https://github.com/faceyspacey/webpack-flush-chunks)
- [extract-css-chunks-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/faceyspacey/extract-css-chunks-webpack-plugin)
- [babel-plugin-universal-import](https://github.com/faceyspacey/babel-plugin-universal-import) 

Feel free to use it as a boilerpate.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/faceyspacey/universal-demo.git
cd universal-demo
yarn
yarn start
```


## Things To Do
- Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser
- Click "CHANGE PAGE" to cycle through dynamically imported pages
- refresh on any page
- and then view the source in the browser to see what chunks are being sent on each page
- **view the primary code in:** ***[src/components/App.js](./src/components/App.js)***
- open the Network tab to see when imports are fetched
- edit the components to see that HMR works--even for split chunks.
- edit and save the CSS files to confirm HMR works for CSS as well, thanks to [extract-css-chunks-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/faceyspacey/extract-css-chunks-webpack-plugin)

- examine the build folders to see exactly what chunks and files are built for you 



*Long live the dreams of Universal HMR* and ***Universal Code-Splitting!***
